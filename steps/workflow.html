<h2>HTML5 Workflow</h2>

<q>When starting a new project I'd really like to use Yeoman if possible, I install new packages with Bower and use Grunt for live-reload, concat, preprocess CSS, jshint, coffee->js. When new commits are pushed to the Git repository they are tested using Jenkins Continuous Integration, the tests are succesfull the version gets deployed to a development server. I prefer creating new features in branches an merging them back to the master when they are finished.</q>
